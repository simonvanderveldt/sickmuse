Installation Dependencies
----------------------------------------

Requires Python 2.6 or 2.7 and the following Python libraries:

- tornado >= 2.4 (Available under Apache v2)
- python-rrdtool >= 1.4 (Available under LGPL v3)

These dependencies do not ship with the library but will be resolved during the install::

    pip install sickmuse


Running the Server
----------------------------------------

Sick Muse runs on the `Tornado <http://www.tornadoweb.org/>`_ webserver which is a
single-threaded non-blocking server. Once installed you run this server using the ``sickmuse``
command::

    sickmuse
    
This will start the server running on the default port ``8282``. You can change the port
using the ``--port`` option::

    sickmuse --port=8080
